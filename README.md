**TaskFlow | Personal Project | React.js, Context API, Tailwind CSS, Local Storage**

Architected a dynamic React application to streamline task management by implementing robust **role-based access control (RBAC)** for two distinct user types: **Admin** and **Employee**. This separation of concerns creates a focused and efficient workflow for all users.

Engineered two separate, purpose-built dashboards. The Admin dashboard provides a centralized command center for creating new tasks, assigning them to specific employees, and monitoring overall project progress. The Employee dashboard offers a personalized view, allowing users to track their assigned tasks through **four unique statuses** (New, Accepted, Completed, and Failed).

To create a seamless, single-page application experience without a backend, I implemented client-side data persistence using browser **local storage**. This ensures that all user and task data is preserved across sessions. Application-wide state is managed cleanly and efficiently using the **React Context API**, eliminating prop-drilling and simplifying data flow.

The front end was constructed with a responsive, mobile-first philosophy using **Tailwind CSS**. The application's architecture is highly modular, built upon a library of over **10 reusable React components** that ensure a maintainable codebase and a modern, intuitive user experience.
